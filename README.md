# Simple Iris model using XGBoost

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald
Fisher in his 1936 paper *The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems* as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes
called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related
species.

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured
from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed
a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

> Make sure to build the model with XGBoost version 0.82 (requirements.txt)

> An example input to interact with the model can be found in `input.json`
